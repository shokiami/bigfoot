In doing this project, I think I learned a lot about design and the structure of programming
projects. Most of my previous experience had been on my own, doing my own projects and learning
by my self. Although I did work on projects on my own, I think that this project really taught
me the structure, and design that is needed to pull of a big project, especially when multiple
people are involved. There is definitly a need for abstraction when multiple people are
involved, so that there is a defined interface that other people can use, even if they don't
understand what you are doing or if you haven't implemented that part yet.

I really enjoyed learning and applying computer science to environmental problems, because I
am interested in environmental science, and it put a really different take on this project. It
was really fun to have the freedom to choose the topic of the project, and because of this I
was much more involved and excited about working on the project.

One big challenges we faced in this project was how to design the classes and interfaces in our
project. In most of our other projects, we were only working on a couple methods in one class,
so going from that to designing multiple classes was a large step. Overall though, I liked the
experience of designing the classes, we just got hung up on design choices a lot. Another
challenge that we faced in this project was getting enough data for our estimation to be
accurate. A lot of big datasets were pretty expensive, so we had to do some data collection
by hand. If we were to continue, I think more and better data would be a big improvement in
the algorithm.

I think that the freedom to choose and design what we want was very helpful and fun. I know
that I just said that it was a big challenge, but I don't see it as bad, I think that it pushed
us to learn more than we would have otherwise. In addition, because we chose the topic, we were
interested and invested in the project more, which made us work harder on it.
